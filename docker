                 |
               image name
-To see all the runnning containers

if docker does not find any image locally so it downloads that image from docker hub

registry is the online repository
container runs inside docker, where docker is a tool 
containers are isolated enviornment in which you can run your applications

directly download images -> docker pull image_name
example-docker pull ubuntu:20.04
